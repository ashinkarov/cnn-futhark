# Major changes

* We rewrote the beginning of Section 5, which fixed some unfortunate
typos, and addressed the following comments of the reviewers:

> (A) 
> l702-735: Why so much white space? This seems like a perfect place to insert some diagrams/graphs!

> (C)
> - Is the terminology adjoint standard? I've seen "partials" or "1-forms" for these objects.

> (D)
> - l696ff This section may offer opportunities for salvaging some space if you are struggling with the page limit:
>   it feels things are spaced out much more generously than in the other sections.
> - Section 5: There is a drop in quality in the exposition of this section.  It deserves some serious polishing.
> 
> - l717 Having to juggle with the aliases $y = w₃$ and $x = w₀$ obstructs the pattern.
> 
> - l720 What role is served by $f x y$ here?  Why not simply $z = \sin(xy + x)$.
> 
> - l737ff I am totally lost here.  Please provide more calculation steps for each line.
>          You got plenty of unused horizontal space here!
> 
> - l746 "If we inline all the $\bar{w}ᵢ$ definitions"  Again more steps please.
>     If I do this myself, I am left with $\bar{w}₀ = \cos w₃ + (\cos w₃)²·x$ which isn't close to the results you report.
